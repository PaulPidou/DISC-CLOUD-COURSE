\begin{itemize}
	\item {\bf Stage-oriented scheduling}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Computes a DAG of stages for each job in the application
		\item[] \texttt{Lines 10-14}, details in \texttt{Lines 15-27}
		\item Keeps track of which RDD and stage output are materialized
		\item Determines an optimal schedule, minimizing stages
		\item Submit stages as sets of Tasks (\texttt{TaskSets}) to the Task scheduler
		\item[] \texttt{Line 26}
	\end{itemize}

	\item {\bf Data locality principle}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Uses ``preferred location'' information (optionally) attached to each RDD
		\item[] \texttt{Line 20}
		\item Package this information into Tasks and send it to the Task scheduler
	\end{itemize}

	\item {\bf Manages Stage failures}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Failure type: (intermediate) data loss of shuffle output files
		\item Failed stages will be resubmitted
		\item NOTE: Task failures are handled by the Task scheduler, which simply resubmit them if they can be computed with no dependency on previous output

		\item The thread ``swipes'' the queue, and routes event to the corresponding handlers

		\item \texttt{JobWaiter} object is created

	\item {\bf Walk-through to the Job Submitted handler}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Create a new job, called \texttt{ActiveJob}
		\item New job starts with only 1 stage, corresponding to the last stage of the job upon which an action is called
		\item[] \texttt{Lines 8-9}
		\item Use the dependency information to produce additional stages
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Shuffle Dependency: create a new map stage
			\item[] \texttt{Line 16}
			\item Narrow Dependency: pipes them into a single stage
			\item[] \texttt{getMissingParentStages}
