\begin{itemize}
  \item Project goals:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Generality: diverse workloads, operators, job sizes
    \item Low latency: sub-second
    \item Fault tolerance: faults are the norm, not the exception
    \item Simplicity: often comes from generality
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{itemize}
  \item Software engineering point of view
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Hadoop code base is huge
    \item Contributions/Extensions to Hadoop are cumbersome
    \item Java-only hinders wide adoption, but Java support is fundamental
  \end{itemize}

  \item Data abstraction point of view
  \begin{itemize}
    \item New fundamental abstraction RDD
    \item Easy to extend with new operators
    \item More descriptive computing model
  \end{itemize}
  
  \item System/Framework point of view
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Simplified data flow
    \item Faster processing speed
    \item Unified pipeline
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
