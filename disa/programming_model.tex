    \begin{itemize}
    \item Given a list, \emph{map} takes as an argument a function $f$
      (that takes a single argument) and applies it to all element in a list
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{20pt}

  \item \textbf{fold phase:}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Given a list, fold takes as arguments a function $g$ (that
      takes two arguments) and an initial value (an accumulator)
    \item $g$ is first applied to the initial value and the first
      item in the list
    \item The result is stored in an intermediate variable, which is
      used as an input together with the next item to a second
      application of $g$

      been consumed

  \item \textbf{We can view fold as an aggregation operation}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The aggregation is defined by the function $g$
    \item Data locality: elements in the list must be ``brought
      together''
    \item If we can {\color{red} \textbf{group}} elements of the list, also the fold phase can proceed in parallel

    \item Imposing the key-value structure on arbitrary datasets\footnote{There's more about it: here we only look at the input to the map function.}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item E.g.: for a collection of Web pages, input keys may be URLs
        and values may be the HTML content
      \end{itemize}
    \item In some algorithms, input keys are not used, in others they
      uniquely identify a record

      the key
    \item No ordering is guaranteed across reducers
   \end{itemize}

  \item \textbf{Output keys from reducers are written back to the
      distributed filesystem}
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The output may consist of $r$ distinct files, where $r$ is
      the number of reducers
    \item Such output may be the input to a subsequent MapReduce phase\footnote{Think of \textbf{iterative algorithms}.}
