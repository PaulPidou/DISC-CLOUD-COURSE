{"name":"Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing","tagline":"Lecture Notes and Laboratory Material for the Cloud Computing Course at Eurecom","body":"# Course Description\r\nThe goal of this course is to provide a comprehensive view on recent topics and trends in distributed systems and cloud computing. We will discuss the software techniques employed to construct and program reliable, highly-scalable systems. We will also cover architecture design of modern datacenters and virtualization techniques that constitute a central topic of the cloud computing paradigm. The course is complemented by a number of lab sessions to get hands-on experience with Hadoop and the design of scalable algorithms with MapReduce.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\nKnowledge of data structures, algorithm design, distributed algorithms. Being fluent with Java and at least another programming language (python is recommended, scala is required for advanced topics) is highly desirable.\r\n\r\n## Recommended Books\r\n* Data-intensive Text Processing with MapReduce, by Jimmy Lin and Chris Dyer [[GitHub Link]](http://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/)\r\n* Hadoop, The Definitive Guide, by Tom White [[Amazon Link]](http://www.amazon.com/Hadoop-Definitive-Guide-Tom-White/dp/1449311520/)\r\n* Hadoop Operations,by Eric Sammer [[Amazon Link]](http://www.amazon.com/Hadoop-Operations-Eric-Sammer/dp/1449327052/)\r\n* HBase, The Definitive Guide, by Lars George [[Amazon Link]](http://www.amazon.com/HBase-Definitive-Guide-Lars-George/dp/1449396100/)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
