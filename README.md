Data-intensive Scalable Computing

Cloud Computing

This repo contains the Latex sources of some of the lecture notes of the Distributed Systems and Cloud Computing course at Eurecom.

### DISC or Distributed Systems?
Actually, a bit of both, but I couldn't figure out a short name for all of that.

### Who?
This repo is maintained by [Pietro Michiardi](http://www.eurecom.fr/~michiard).

I work at [Eurecom](http://www.eurecom.fr)
